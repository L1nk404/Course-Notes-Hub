## So, what's a bit?  ##

Bits can be either 1 or 0 , and it is the basic unit in computing.

## And about the bytes

A byte is a sequence of 8 bits, like "01010101" or "11011000"

## And about Binary Number?

To understand what is a Binary Number, let's start understanding a Decimal
Number:

A decimal number is a base 10 number, that means that we can form 10 different
values with a digit, let's see a example, take the number 2463:

       THOUSANDS + HUNDREDS + TENS     + UNITS
 2463 = 2 * 10^3 + 4 * 10^2 + 6 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0

- A Decimal Number consists of "digits"
- "digits" are placed at "positions", fom right to lef, starting at position 0.
- There's a "weight" associated with each digit position where weight = base^(position).

Now we can start talk about Binary Number.
A Binary Number is a base two number set by bits.

We have for example:

Decimal value | Binary value

0               1   
1               1
2               10
3               11
4               100
5               110
...             ...

- There are digits (0/1). The numbers can be represented by multiple digits.
- Everytime we add a new digit to a left position.

# Converting Binary Numbers into to Decimal

From base 2 to base 10 we use the equation above: weight = base^(position):

1101 (binary) = 1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 (decimal)

# Converting Decimal into Binary Numbers




# Base notations

1. Decimal Numbers Base 10 Notations:
    n_{10} (n if 10 subscript)
    n_{d}  (n if "d" subscript)

2. Binary Numbers Base 2 Notations:
    n_{2} for example 101_{2} = 5_{10}
    n_{b} or 101_{b} = 5_{d}
